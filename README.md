# Asteroids

A replica of the classic game "Asteroids" from the 1980's

This version includes more interesing UFOs compared to the original, which dodge asteroids and fly after the player, moving in the same way the player would. 
The asteroids are also random in shape, and there are some currently incomplete features such as a mother ship boss that spawns UFOs, a friendly ship to help you, and a giant space snake.



I originally made this as a university project but have since expanded upon it. 
I should mention this uses some coding practices I would avoid if I were to start this project again today, due to experience I have gained since as well as some questionable choices I had to make purely to meet the assignment criteria (they wanted all the entities in one list)
